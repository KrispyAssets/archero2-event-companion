      <p>This guide explains how lake pools work, how to plan your lure spend, and how to maximize rewards with two main strategies.</p>

    <section section_id="what_to_buy" title="What to Buy">
      <p>Always buy the lures available for silver tickets. They are worth more than they cost every time.</p>
      <p>Buying etched runes for your main builds is the main reason to play this event. Top etched runes include Arrow of Echoes, Elemental Crit, Meteor Split, and Potion Spring.</p>
      <p>Buying all the blessed runes is recommended. Progress toward unlocking all etched rune slots is always welcome.</p>
      <p>Mythic artifacts are a decent option once you have the etched runes you want.</p>
      <p>Do not buy keys unless you are playing for free. It is better to spend gems on keys directly.</p>
      <p>It costs roughly 37 keys worth of gems to buy one S tier gear. Not recommended unless it is a personal choice.</p>

      <p>Fish per pool: 1 legendary, 3 big epics, 6 small epics, 5 large rares, 10 medium rares, 15 small rares.</p>
      <p>On average you gain 390 silver tickets per lure in the final lake.</p>

    <section section_id="how_lakes_work" title="How the Lakes Work">
      <p>Fishing may seem random at first, but it is not. You can predict fish pools and plan your lures.</p>
      <p>In the first three lakes the fish pool is the same; in the final lake the pool is doubled.</p>
      <p>Pools contain 40 fish: 1 legendary, 9 epics, and 30 rares.</p>
      <p>Pools reset only when you catch all fish. Snapping lines does not remove fish from the pool.</p>
      <p>Moving to a new lake starts a fresh pool in that lake. The previous lake pool stays intact as you left it.</p>
      <p>Final lake pool doubles to 80 fish: 2 legendaries, 18 epics, 60 rares.</p>

    <section section_id="strategy_options" title="Two Main Strategies">
      <section section_id="option_1_overview" title="Option 1: Maximize Silver Tickets">
        <p>Spend many gems to maximize silver tickets.</p>
        <p>Expect to spend 20-30k gems. Move through lakes using as few lures as possible.</p>
        <p>Estimated gains: 110k-130k silver tickets and 16 golden tickets or more.</p>
      </section>
      <section section_id="option_2_overview" title="Option 2: Maximize Golden Tickets">
        <p>Spend fewer gems to maximize golden tickets.</p>
        <p>Expect to spend 5-15k gems. You will gain fewer silver tickets but fewer gems are required to reach 16 golden tickets.</p>
        <p>Estimated gains: 70k-90k silver tickets and 16 golden tickets.</p>

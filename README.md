# Archero 2 Event Companion

A community-made web companion for Archero 2 events.

## Purpose
- Reduce Discord scrolling and repeated questions
- Provide an event-first hub with:
  - Task tracking + progress (auto-saves locally; no accounts)
  - In-app guides + searchable FAQs
  - Optional event tools (calculators, recommenders, planners)

## How it works (high level)
- Event content lives in data files under `public/catalog/` (multiple files).
- The app loads a catalog index and renders a standard Event template.
- Progress is stored locally and can be exported/imported via a save code.

## Contributing
PRs are welcome, especially for event data, guides, and FAQs.
See `CONTRIBUTING.md` once added.

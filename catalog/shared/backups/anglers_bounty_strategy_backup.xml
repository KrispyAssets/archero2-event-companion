    <section section_id="option_1_overview" title="Option 1: Maximize Silver Tickets">
      <p>Spend many gems to maximize silver tickets.</p>
      <p>Expect to spend 20-30k gems. Move through lakes using as few lures as possible.</p>
      <p>Estimated gains: 110k-130k silver tickets and 16 golden tickets or more.</p>
      <section section_id="lakehouse_option_1" title="Lake 1: Lakehouse (Option 1)">
        <p>You will be fishing for 2 or 3 legendary fish.</p>
        <p>Fish a full pool of 40 first, then start on 2x.</p>
        <p>Catch all epics and legendaries; snap lines if only rares are on the line.</p>
        <p>Goal: catch the 2nd legendary and move to Lake 2 quickly.</p>
        <p>If you catch the legendary early, catch the remaining fish to reach Lake 2.</p>

      <section section_id="sunset_coast_option_1" title="Lake 2: Sunset Coast (Option 1)">
        <p>You will be getting 3 legendary fish.</p>
        <p>Fish two full pools of 40. After 80 fish, switch to 2x multiplier.</p>
        <p>Catch all epics and the legendary; snap all solely rare fish.</p>
        <p>After catching the legendary, catch all fish until you reach Lake 3.</p>

      <section section_id="oceanic_abyss_option_1" title="Lake 3: Oceanic Abyss (Option 1)">
        <p>You will be getting 3 or 4 legendary fish. Fish two full pools of 40 first.</p>
        <p>Start on 2x multiplier, catch all epics and legendaries, and snap lines if only rares appear.</p>
        <p>Goal: catch the 3rd legendary and move to the final lake quickly.</p>
        <p>If you catch the legendary early, catch the remaining fish to reach the final lake.</p>

      <section section_id="polar_glacier_option_1" title="Final Lake: Polar Glacier (Option 1)">
        <p>This lake doubles the pool to 80 fish, creating a copy of every fish.</p>
        <p>Minimum of 242 lures to reach 16 gold tickets.</p>
        <p>Pull on 10x until you have spent what you want, tracking every 80 fish.</p>
        <p>On your last pool of 80, use final line breaks to collect all epics and legendaries.</p>
      </section>
    </section>
    <section section_id="option_2_overview" title="Option 2: Maximize Golden Tickets">
      <p>Spend fewer gems to maximize golden tickets.</p>
      <p>Expect to spend 5-15k gems. You will gain fewer silver tickets but fewer gems are required to reach 16 golden tickets.</p>
      <p>Estimated gains: 70k-90k silver tickets and 16 golden tickets.</p>
      <section section_id="lakehouse_option_2" title="Lake 1: Lakehouse (Option 2)">
        <p>Gather a second full pool of 40 to push into Lake 2, then go back to Lake 1.</p>
        <p>Pull on 1x and snap all lines except for the legendary fish.</p>
        <p>Once you have the 3rd legendary on Lake 1, move to Lake 2.</p>
        <p>If you are over 75 snapped lines and you have not caught the legendary, switch to Option 1.</p>
      </section>
      <section section_id="sunset_coast_option_2" title="Lake 2: Sunset Coast (Option 2)">
        <p>If you are low on line snaps (more than 50 used) after Lake 1, skip this step.</p>
        <p>Otherwise fish two full pools of 40, then switch to 2x multiplier.</p>
        <p>Catch all epics and the legendary; snap all solely rare fish.</p>
        <p>After catching the legendary, catch all fish until you reach Lake 3.</p>
      </section>
      <section section_id="oceanic_abyss_option_2" title="Lake 3: Oceanic Abyss (Option 2)">
        <p>Gather a third full pool of 40 to push into the final lake, then go back to Lake 3.</p>
        <p>Pull on 1x and snap all lines except for the legendary fish.</p>
        <p>Once you have the 4th legendary fish, move to the final lake.</p>

      <section section_id="polar_glacier_option_2" title="Final Lake: Polar Glacier (Option 2)">
        <p>This lake doubles the pool to 80 fish, creating a copy of every fish.</p>
        <p>Minimum of 162 lures to reach 16 gold tickets.</p>
        <p>Pull two full pools of 80, then use all line breaks left to try for the final two legendaries.</p>
